{-| If the GUI communicates with outside world using ports

- It sends stringified to the given ports: see `example/ReportToJsString` and `Tron.Expose.*` modules' documentation for details;
- It is _detachable_, so part of the GUI may be moved to another tab/browser/device and they communicate using WebSocket server using given ports: see `example/Detachable` for details, ensure to run `example/start-server.sh` before running `start-example Detachable`;

{- This is the only function you need to make your `GUI` _detachable*_. However, this function requires some ports to be present as an argument, so you'll need a pair of ports as well. And a WebSocket server. But that's it!

    _*_ â€” _detachable GUI_ in the context of Web Application means that you may move parts of your user interface to another browser window, tab, or even another device, such as a phone, a tablet, TV, VR glasses or whatever has a browser inside nowadays.

    For a detailed example, see `example/Detachable` in the sources.

    port receive : (Exp.RawInUpdate -> msg) -> Sub msg

    port transmit : Exp.RawOutUpdate -> Cmd msg

    port ack : Exp.Ack -> Cmd msg

This needs `example/ws-client.js` and `example/ws-server.js` to exist. The server should be started before running the application with `node ./ws-server.js`, and `ws-client.js` just needs be included in your HTML, and then:

    const app = Elm.YourApp.Main.init({
        node : document.getElementById("elm-node")
    });

    startWs(app.ports.ack, app.ports.receive, app.ports.transmit);


See `example/Detachable` for details.

- `ack` sends the client ID if is new (randomly-generated) or the exising one (was specified in the URL);
- `transmit` sends the JSON value and path to it, when value was changed;
- `receive` receives the value updates from the clients with the same ID;
